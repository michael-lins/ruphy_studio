# Ruphy

Rails is great, but building apps still feels a bit old. Scaffolds are cold. Generators don’t care about what the user sees.  
**Ruphy** is my answer to that.

It’s a Rails assistant that launches with your app, shows up inside your browser, and helps you build your UI first—then connect it to the backend.  
No setup, no configs. Just flow.

---

## What It Is

- A small Electron launcher that starts your Rails 8 app
- Opens your browser and adds **Ruphino**, a small dog icon
- You click Ruphino and see a radial menu with UI elements
- You can drop these into your page and later connect them to controllers/models
- No React, no webpack—only Rails, Hotwire, and Solid Queue

---

## Who It’s For

- New Rails devs who want to see things working quickly
- Solo devs building ideas fast
- People who want to learn Rails by seeing and doing
- Devs who miss the fun of making things visually

---

## What Works Today

- Rails 8 app starts from Electron
- Ruphino appears inside the browser
- Radial menu shows up with test components
- Some UI elements can be inserted (basic and static for now)
- Rails + Hotwire + Solid Queue setup is running

---

## What’s Coming Next

- Add form and list UI components that connect to real models
- Pick a model and choose which controller/action to link
- Save assistant state between sessions
- Improve menu with shortcuts and helpers

---

## Why I’m Building This

Because Rails can be easier for beginners.  
Because starting from the UI helps people learn faster.  
Because building things should feel fun again.

And because I’ve been using Rails since 2007 for study and side projects, and professionally since 2018.  
I know it well, and I believe we can make it better.
